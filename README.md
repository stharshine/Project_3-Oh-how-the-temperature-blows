# Oh, how the temperature blows


## Data Sources

https://api.windy.com/point-forecast

## Description:

App Windy is a professional weather app that gives information about Temperature, Wind speed, and pressure.
The UK has quite an interesting weather, so having information about 20 different cities and their wind and temperature was insightful. 
We can comfortably say that our weather enjoys throwing a tantrum every so often.

## Questions:

Questions we could have analysed:

- What are the changes in temperature within different cities in the UK?
- What are the changes in wind within different cities in the UK?
- What is the average temperature within each UK reagion?
- What is the temperature trend in each city throughout the day?


## Analysis:

Extracted data from the API onto Jupiter notebook, where we cleaned and separated the dataset into two (temperature and wind speed).
We pushed the two datasets into 2 different CSVs.
On Flask App.py we created two SQLite databases using the two CSV datasets we just cleaned.
We created the front end of our website using a mix of HTML and CSS 
We then connected it with Javascript pages which allowed us to analyse our dataset.  
We used D3 and Plotly libraries.
App.py was used to call everything.

## Challenges and Limitations: 

The project was as harsh as our winds during winter!
The limited experience, time, and confidence impacted us a lot.
We would have loved to use an extra library (such as charts) and since there are multiple possibilities for data analysis with the information extracted, it would have been fun to showcase our dataset differently. 
Ideally it would have been good to have had more time to understand the concepts of Javascript and HTML.
We worked hard in understanding the concept and pushing ourselves to give our best work.
